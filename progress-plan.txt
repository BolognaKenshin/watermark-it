   screen if angle applied from any position besides photo center.

1/28

1/29
 - Spent a lot of time trying to see if opacity can be edited to make pasted text lighter
 - Seems to be consequence of paste, likely blending
 - Subtle, just leave

1/30
 - Began working on logo window
 - Drag-and-drop upload for logo done
 - Able to upload logo via upload button
 - Need to add a cancel button to upload logo window, also make it force interaction before moving on
 - Problem where user may accidentally drag logo onto main window, uploading on main photo_canvas
 - Figured out that if you save an uploaded logo image as a canvas attribute, using it later on for resizing
 calculations distorts the image aspect ratio. Instead, store the file path, call a new one for resizing independent
 of the canvas to address.

 1/31
