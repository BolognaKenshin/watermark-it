# Watermark-it 

## How it works
A basic watermark application, takes image files on the main window. Allows the user to generate a text watermark with some free fonts, more can be added to the fonts folder.
Text options include size, fonts, color, opacity, rotation, tiling, placement. 
Also allows the user to upload a logo (PNG only) and customize placement, tiling, size, and rotation.
Logo and text watermarks can also be moved via dragging with the mouse.
